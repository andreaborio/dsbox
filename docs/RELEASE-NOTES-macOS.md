## macOS community build

This release contains the Apple Silicon build of DSBox.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The app is ad-hoc signed for bundle integrity, but it is not signed with an
> Apple Developer ID and is not notarized. macOS will require one explicit
> approval on first launch. Read the attached installation guide before opening
> the app.
